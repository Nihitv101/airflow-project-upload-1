Each satellite is unpressurized and weighs 935 kg,  and has an operational lifetime of 10 years.","launch_designator":null,"type":"Navigation","orbit":{"id":12,"name":"Medium Earth Orbit","abbrev":"MEO"}},"pad":{"id":48,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.0.0/pad/48/","agency_id":163,"name":"Unknown Pad","info_url":null,"wiki_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plesetsk_Cosmodrome","map_url":"https://www.google.com/maps?q=62.925556,40.577778","latitude":"62.925556","longitude":"40.577778","location":{"id":6,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.0.0/location/6/","name":"Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russian Federation","country_code":"RUS","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_6_20200803142434.jpg","total_launch_count":1668,"total_landing_count":0},"map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_48_20200803143459.jpg","total_launch_count":0},"webcast_live":false,"image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/soyuz_2.1b_image_20230802085331.jpg","infographic":null,"program":[]},{"id":"525ed290-dd97-4187-9118-d71f0b8285be","url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.0.0/launch/525ed290-dd97-4187-9118-d71f0b8285be/","launch_library_id":null,"slug":"falcon-9-block-5-oneweb-20","name":"Falcon 9 Block 5 | OneWeb 20","status":{"id":2,"name":"TBD"},"net":"2024-09-30T00:00:00Z","window_end":"2024-09-30T00:00:00Z","window_start":"2024-09-30T00:00:00Z","inhold":false,"tbdtime":true,"tbddate":true,"probability":null,"holdreason":"","failreason":"","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":121,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.0.0/agencies/121/","name":"SpaceX","type":"Commercial"},"rocket":{"id":8309,"configuration":{"id":164,"launch_library_id":188,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.0.0/config/launcher/164/","name":"Falcon 9","family":"Falcon","full_name":"Falcon 9 Block 5","variant":"Block 5"}},"mission":{"id":6890,"launch_library_id":null,"name":"OneWeb 20","description":"A batch of 20 satellites for the OneWeb satellite constellation, which is intended to provide global Internet broadband service for individual consumers.
